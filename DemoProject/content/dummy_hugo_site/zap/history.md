Lorem ipsum became a bit scrambled over time, but the version we use
today [**comes from a work**](https://priceonomics.com/the-history-of-lorem-ipsum/) known
as *de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum*, written by Cicero in 45 BC. The work
concerns ethics; the section that lorem ipsum comes from is a warning
against self-indulgence.

Sometime in the 1500s, a typesetter decided to scramble the passage
of *de Finibus* in order to test fonts without being distracted by the
words themselves. Thus *lorem ipsum* was born, and its usage has
survived hundreds of years later into the modern era.
