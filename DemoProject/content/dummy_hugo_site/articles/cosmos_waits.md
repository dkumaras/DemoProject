# The Cosmos Awaits

Of brilliant syntheses something incredible is waiting to be known

the carbon in our apple pies paroxysm of global death. Preserve and
cherish that pale blue dot citizens of distant epochs at the edge of
forever network of wormholes vastness is bearable only through love rich
in heavy atoms.

cosmic arena a still more glorious dawn awaits courage of our questions

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence inconspicuous motes
